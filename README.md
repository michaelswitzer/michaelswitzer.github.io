# Welcome
My personal website is written using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I use the default minima theme, which I have modified a little bit to suit my needs:

* Multiple blog setup
* Angel.co social button
* Some smart filtering/routing using [Liquid](https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid/basics)
* More tiny tweaks
