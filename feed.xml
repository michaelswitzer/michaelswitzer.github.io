&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;/software/2018/01/01/data-driven-product-management-part1.html&quot;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; of this post, we took on the mindset of a CEO looking to improve their companies’ products through investing in more people, better people, and IP. In this post, we’ll explore a fourth area of investment: &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt;. We will describe how successful companies have upended their development strategies and implemented processes that allowed them to get better insights into their customer base through a technique called “data-driven decision making strategies” (DDDM). We’ll conclude with an example of how Amazon continues to grow traffic on their front page without seriously risking a misstep and interrupting their revenue streams. Let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happened-to-my-versions&quot;&gt;What happened to my versions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the stone ages, when you bought software like MS Word or TurboTax it had a version attached to it. Your copy of Photoshop 6 had major feature improvements over Photoshop 5, and they were released about a year apart. You may have noticed that most products don’t do this anymore, and web-based products like the Amazon homepage and Google search don’t even show you a version number. What gives? This change reflects a major shift in software design practices toward a method known as “Agile development”. What is Agile in a nutshell? Well let’s start with the method we explored in part 1, known as Waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/data-driven-design/waterfall_dev_photoshop.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Waterfall: design, build, test, ship&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Waterfall, each version of your software is divided into three major parts: design, build and test. At the end of this cycle, usually months later, you release a full fledged version update with big shifts from version to version. This method worked well for a long time, and made sense in a world where shipping software couldn’t be done easily over the internet. Selling software in a physical store required supply chains to be set up, CDs to be stamped, etc., and you usually had a long lead time to work the kinks out. You could align your Waterfall-based releases with the physical release of software and make a successful product out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the internet became widely available, this methodology made a lot less sense and companies that released faster and faster became more and more successful. As a quick example, if google.com only updated their search engine index and algorithm once per year, they obviously wouldn’t be in business. So companies completely changed their outlook, moving to a methodology where design, build and test are fully integrated into a consistent pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/data-driven-design/agile_dev.svg&quot; alt=&quot;following Agile: design, build and test is done on separate branches and merged to master later&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The master branch of the product is considered to be release-quality at all times, because all of the experimental work is performed and tested on separate branches of code. Once the branch is merged, integration tests are run to ensure that quality is maintained throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using agile methodologies, the idea of a major release was no longer necessary. Code was shipped very often, in much smaller chunks (usually one feature at a time) and could be given to the customer at the rate the developers churned it out with very little overhead. This enabled web-based apps to ship code quicker and more often, and really changed the face of software development forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick aside for a disclaimer: This process explanation is just scratching the surface of how these systems work. There are many many books written on development practices and I am dramatically simplifying things for the sake of getting to the data stuff (I promise it’s coming!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Waterfall to Agile was the first huge shift. What was the next one? I think you can guess, but if you’re truly doubting that I’m finally getting to the point, the answer is DDDM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-get-serious&quot;&gt;Let’s get serious&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When dealing with a highly available software product such as an e-commerce store or a search engine, the stakes are very high. Tiny preterbations in how things work can have massive effects. I heard an anecdote from a PM on a major ecommerce product that one of their developers checked in a change that moved their checkout button one pixel down, and it caused their revenue to plummet by 6%. Six percent for one pixel! In a growth oriented software economy, this could be a death sentence for a product. Why did one pixel mean so much? After spending a lot of money on researchers to figure this out, it turned out the checkout button had been moved outside of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxplanet.org/z-shaped-pattern-for-reading-web-content-ce1135f92f1c&quot;&gt;Z-shaped scan pattern&lt;/a&gt; that eyes usually follow when reading a web page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned that a 6% drop in revenue could spell death for a product. So why did this one survive? And how did they correct the problem before it was too late? It turns out the company was at no risk at all, thanks to the DDDM practices they had implemented. The vast majority of their customers had never even seen the change that caused such devastation to their bottom line and the research the company had paid for to figure out the root cause was not so that fingers could be pointed at a developer for messing up, but to improve future development on the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how they did it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/data-driven-design/agile_dev_DDDM.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Agile, but with an experiment every time you merge to master branch&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the Agile pipeline, instead of shipping their code out to all of their customers, they only show a select few their new feature. Automated processes will ship their code to a tiny fraction of users, then start tracking the user’s behavior automatically. User performance can be measured through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which can mean revenue, user retention rate, CPU overhead, or any other priority of the company or department. I’ll write a post on selecting KPIs in the future, but for now let’s work with revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon pushing the new code to the ecommerce site, about 0.001% of users browsing to the site saw the checkout button moved one pixel. The automated build process tracked the revenue of users that were browsing the new site vs. the old site, and produced a report indicating that the revenue had dramatically dropped with the new version. With zero human intervention, the build process detected this and reverted the change, saving the company millions. The team responsible for the change was informed and it was back to the drawing board for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-real-world-example&quot;&gt;A Real World Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you don’t have to rely on my 6% anecdote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/data-driven-design/amazon-home-page.png&quot; alt=&quot;the Amazon home page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Amazon homepage has hundreds of clickable elements and updates every single day with new products and feature announcements. It also drives a massive amount of revenue for the company. If the site went down for even a few minutes, it means &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2016/03/11/how-much-did-amazons-outage-cost-online-giant/&quot;&gt;millions&lt;/a&gt; of dollars lost. You would imagine it is very frightening to work on a team that manages the front page. But the vast majority of the risk involved is mitigated through their build process. Let’s say the team is directed to increase checkout button clickthrough rate for the page, and they have a few different proposals for how:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Program Manager A wants the checkout button to be 10% bigger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/data-driven-design/amazon-home-page-A.png&quot; alt=&quot;the Amazon home page, with a bigger checkout button&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Program Manager B wants the ad on the page reworded to something more persuasive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/data-driven-design/amazon-home-page-B.png&quot; alt=&quot;the Amazon home page, with a more pursuasive ad.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Program Manager C wants the page to automatically redirect to the checkout screen after five seconds if the user doesn’t do anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/data-driven-design/amazon-home-page-C.gif&quot; alt=&quot;the Amazon home page, with automatic redirects.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, they might appeal their proposals to their director of product management, and try to make their cases with good old fashioned powerpoint. Now they just get to work implementing all three changes and let them all duke it out in a no holds barred cage match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three separate experiments are run by the build process and the results come rolling in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Experiment A&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Experiment B&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Experiment C&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Revenue&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;+1%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;+1%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;-46%&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Clickthrough Rate&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;+2%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;+3%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;+54%&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Satisfaction Survey&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;+1%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;-64%&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;User Retention Rate&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;+1%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;+2%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;-92%&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A and B results provide incremental improvements to the clickthrough rate, so those PMs are pretty happy. PM C, though, is beside themselves and cannot stop bragging to everyone. They boast a massive improvement to the metric their boss asked them to improve! Surely a raise is in sight for them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But PM C’s change never makes it to production, because it made all the other KPIs much worse. They’ve decided to force their users to go to the checkout screen, and didn’t reckon on the consequences catching up to them. Done right, DDDM is very hard to cheat. There are no short cuts to beat the system with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A and B’s features make it to production and they enjoy a healthy bonus the following year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does DDDM have any downsides? Sure. It can be expensive to implement these complex testing frameworks and systems, so smaller firms have difficulty keeping up with larger companies. It also, for better or for worse, removes some of the human element of product design. If developers are left unsupervised and the KPIs are prioritized poorly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/e8r47hZX2G8&quot;&gt;dark patterns&lt;/a&gt; of software design can emerge. Even in more ethically produced products, users can begin to feel alienated or manipulated if they catch on to the game that the companies are playing with them. These arguments are worth exploring, but since DDDM is here to stay until the next big paradigm shift inevitably comes, we are better off just trying to make it as functional and powerful a tool as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The freedom to try new things with zero risk has been revolutionary for software. Incremental improvements are now happening constantly to nearly every major web-based product, while you are experimented on without even knowing what is happening. And now when developers or PMs face a fork in the road or a question of how to implement a new feature, it is often the case that &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; features will be implemented and tested, leaving the strongest implementation to show beyond any shadow of a doubt that it is superior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are huge implications for scaling and growing the company as well. While hiring great employees still makes a huge difference, firms can distribute good leaders more thinly across the organization, enabling larger teams to contribute on the same products and still maintain a cohesive vision and strategy. Teams can gain significantly more autonomy now that their decisions are validated by data rather than the intuitions of leadership. A bottom-up culture has grown among tech and now most major feature decisions are made at a lower level of management. Management’s role has also evolved, requiring shrewd data analysts rather than business people with good instincts. Rather than issuing directives like “build me this feature”, they can delegate tasks like “increase checkout button clickthrough rate by 6% in the next year” and allow teams the ability to figure out what that means. DDDM has created an entirely new world for software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thank-you&quot;&gt;Thank you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this post! It was fun to write and I hope you learned something along the way. Though you might not use DDDM directly in your career, understanding how software is made can help you understand how to be a better consumer. If you are making software today and do not employ DDDM, I highly recommend reading more and pitching some ideas to your employer. If they won’t listen, they may not be around in the future to hear you out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the beginnings of this blog, I thought I would write a high-leveled introduction to what I consider the most important conceptual framework that drives product development today: Data-driven decision making (DDDM). Even for non-tech folks, understanding the basics of DDDM and how it is used to build products can help you protect yourself as a consumer and understand how companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft manage to maintain high standards of quality even as their companies scale considerably year over year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone currently in a product management role, understanding the intricacies of DDDM can mean the difference between a decent product and a hugely successful one. This post is primarily aimed at the total newbie, so if you are already familiar with DDDM and want to get serious about it at your organization, this post is likely not going to be very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last thing I want to say is that while I plan to give examples of how specific products achieve their goals through DDDM, I have never worked for any of the companies I reference and cannot tell you for sure if they are following the practices I describe exactly. I am going to be purposefully broad about this in any case, so don’t take my word as bond. This is really meant to be an introduction for the complete layman, which will necessarily involve a lot of hand waving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that preface out of the way, let’s get into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-stone-ages&quot;&gt;The Stone Ages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a fairly innocuous question: how do big companies make their products better? If the CEO of Microsoft wanted 5% more people to use Outlook by the end of the year, how would they use their budget to do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were developing software in 2002, you might try:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hire more people to make more features faster&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hire smarter people to research human behavior and make a product people want&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buy a competing company to acquire their userbase and intellectual property&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These answers are all good, and for a long time, represented the primary ways to get ahead in software. If you weren’t shipping fast enough, hire more hands. If people didn’t like your products, hire experts to tell you why. And if someone did it better anyways, buy ‘em out and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of investment strategy is also conducive to the prevailing development paradigm of that era: “Waterfall”  development. I won’t speak too much about different development strategies in this post (that’s for another day) but it is important to point out here that every aspect of software development in inextricably linked together: Investment strategies lead to hiring strategies lead to development strategies lead to shipping strategies, and changing one development paradigm can often impact the entire process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/data-driven-design/waterfall_dev.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Waterfall: design, build, test, ship&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In “waterfall” development, software is made in distinct drawn out phases that cannot be started until the previous phase is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These phases are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Requirements are collected and synthesized.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software is designed and built.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A separate team ensures it has the quality necessary to ship.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The product is shipped out to the public by a separate business unit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team, exhausted from their release party, begin the process anew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When pursuing the investment strategies I outlined above, it’s easy to see where the decisions fit in a waterfall model. You can beef up your implementation or test teams if you want to ship faster or higher quality products, or hire big shot product managers to design requirements if you want a product more people want. Simple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s so bad about this approach? How has software development changed since then? Why is this section titled “The Stone Ages”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer lies in the &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt; of your knowledge. Try and answer these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do you know those people you hired are working on the right stuff?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do you know those smart people you hired actually understand your customer and their needs?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do you know the IP you just bought from your competitor is the actual reason they were beating you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you can’t make a product without people, and you can’t succeed in an industry without subject matter experts, at the end of the day what you’re participating in is &lt;em&gt;educated guesswork&lt;/em&gt;. Your team could be on a truly disastrous trajectory and until your next major release comes out and you get your sales numbers back, there’s almost no way to really know you’ve made a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-team-to-do&quot;&gt;What is a team to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a fourth area to invest in here, beyond the three I outlined above. What if instead of asking your employees what the customer wants, you figured out how to make the customer tell you directly? Seems simple enough, and it even fits into your current paradigms! Just get those experts you hired to run some focus groups and user surveys and let the customer speak for themselves. Sounds simple enough, right? Well while those methods can get some useful information, they are pretty expensive to do all the time and can disrupt the flow of development by introducing delays or just producing ambiguous or bad data. In order for this approach to be useful, it needs to be &lt;em&gt;baked into the process&lt;/em&gt;. And to do that, it takes a total reinvention of how software is made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve now identified the problem, and the direction we want to move in for the solution. There is a long way to go! In &lt;a href=&quot;/software/2018/01/15/data-driven-product-management-part2.html&quot;&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt; of this post, we will explore how data-driven decision management strategies can be introduced into the day-to-day process of software development, allowing a team to see insights into their customer base and retrieve feedback in real time, without disrupting the overall experience for the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading the first post on my professional blog. Expect more to come.&lt;/p&gt;

How long he wasn’t exactly sure, but it had certainly been a few hours since his jump. He was now in pitch black darkness, the pinhole of light that had marked the opening of the hole he had jumped into had been swallowed up by the darkness about an hour into his journey. Though there was still air to breathe and to resist his fall, the whistling of the air caused by his body plummeting was so monotone that his brain had essentially shut it off in his head completely. So he was in total sensory deprivation and thus had a lot of time to think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first he thought about why he had jumped in the first place. He recalled that suicidal people who jump from bridges, canyons and the like will mostly immediately regret their decision moments from taking the plunge, and spend their remaining moments on earth lamenting their poor judgement. Frank wasn’t one of those folks, he realized, because it took hours to come to the conclusion that he shouldn’t have done what he did. Once it was clear that the hole had no bottom, no end in sight to his fall and to his life, the absurdity of death became as clear as the absurdity of life. In this state of falling in total blackness and silence, he was essentially dead already, he thought, and he took some time to process this and realize that he didn’t care much for death either. So with that decided, he didn’t have much else to think about as he had spent the last few weeks of his old life coming to terms with everything he could already. So after a while he was bored, then tired, then sleepy, then asleep. He dreamed he was a fish in an aquarium, aimlessly swimming laps around his tiny world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He woke some time later with a start, not sure what had caused one of the strangest sensations he had ever felt in his life. There had been a sudden lurch in his stomach, a pull not unlike cresting a loop on a roller coaster, where it had seemed like the one constant force in his life (gravity) had for a moment been called into question. This lurch had jolted him awake, and it took several seconds for him to come to and realize he was still falling. He felt intense terror after coming to, but this only lasted a few moments before the tedium of the fall returned to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he tried to get his bearings, he realized that he had somehow flipped upside down in his sleep and was now falling head first down the hole. He considered attempting to flip over again, as now blood was rushing to his head and he felt uncomfortable, but was afraid of that adjustment pushing him out of alignment with the hole and smashing into the side of it, which would certainly maim or kill him at this velocity. With his newfound desire to live (or at least not to die), he wanted to avoid this, though he considered it a strong possibility even if he tried his best since he could not see the sides of the hole at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was getting quite hungry now, and briefly considered what he would do if he became certain he would die of starvation. The desire to avoid discomfort and pain is the first reason he chose the hole as a method of ending his life in the first place (the second reason was to not leave a body for his family to discover or have to identify), so this was a serious concern to him. Aside from trying to smash himself into the walls of the hole, he did not have any way to end this suffering. But this option seemed quite unpleasant, and he knew this decision could be made much later, so on he drifted through the blackness of the hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More time passed, and Frank continued to think. Why was this journey seemingly infinite? He had certainly expected a quick end to existence after his decision to jump. Perhaps he was dead already. But this was impossible; despite his sensory deprivation, the world felt quite real to him. He felt his body: the usual creaks and aches and pains of a sixty-something man were still coming through. His mind was still preoccupied with thoughts of his life, there was no clarity, serenity or Nirvana. No, this was not a death, he was sure of it. But certainly the hole represented a geometric impossibility. The Earth should not have space available to sustain a fall for this long. He began attempting to calculate the distance he had fallen, but without a sense of how much time had passed this was impossible. Scenarios of gravity wells, alternate dimensions, alien interventions and godlike machinations began permeating his consciousness, which did a very good job of distracting him from his ever-growing hunger and thirst. When at last Frank had expended any reasonable possibilities for how his situation made any sense, he happened to tilt his head upwards in the direction he was falling and noticed the light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not clear when the light had appeared, but Frank suspected it was some time before he had noticed it. It looked suspiciously like the entrance to the hole had looked before the darkness swallowed it whole, a pinhole of white light radiating from the darkness like a beacon to him. He appeared to be headed straight for it, which was convenient because Frank was still terrified of his subtle movements throwing himself off course. Christian iconography often describes the ascent to heaven to be a “light at the end of the tunnel”. Frank was never a real believer in any religion, but being American he was fully saturated in the mythologies of Christ in his youth and thus felt the hints of Faith growing in his psyche. He felt so drawn to the light, so excited by the possibility of anything taking him away from the darkness that he reached his hands out in a superman pose, attempting to will himself there faster. After a few minutes his arms hurt and he retracted them, feeling quite silly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But was the light growing? Was he actually headed towards it, or was it just a fixture of the landscape, not unlike the darkness? Yes, he was so sure it was getting closer. But his obsession with staring at the light was causing him to question himself. It is hard to discern subtle changes in any object that is constantly being monitored, so he decided to try and shut his eyes for a few minutes and then open them again to see if the light had changed its size. Before he closed them he briefly considered what would happen if he reopened his eyes to find the light had disappeared; but this possibility was too horrifying to take seriously and thus he willed his lids closed for as long as he could stand. Never a man to be particularly responsible, he accidentally fell asleep again within a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He awoke again with a jolt. “The light!”, He exclaimed aloud, feeling silly again as there was nobody for miles that could hear him or cared to. He looked up and there it was: same pin of light, but significantly larger, now grown to a sphere roughly a quarter of the size that the sun in the sky should be. But now something else was happening to him, something he had felt a few hours prior but could no longer ignore: he was slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feeling of slowdown was very subtle, and Frank was initially not sure it was actually happening since he had no visual point of reference to use. But hours spent without the ability to see, or any other stimuli affecting the senses made his internal gyroscope very acute. And there it was: a sense of slowing. It was very gradual but also quite noticeable. Frank became worried he would not reach the light, that he would eventually slow to a complete halt, or worse yet begin another fall back in the opposite direction, doomed to spend the rest of his life as a helpless pendulum. If this happened, he thought, he would certainly try and reorient himself in such a way that he would make contact with the side of the hole. But in a strange realization he considered the idea that there was no side to this hole, that instead of falling through a tunnel he was instead drifting through infinity, with nowhere to go in any direction. Again this thought was too troubling to fully consider without a total loss of hope. Frank had never truly lost hope, even when he had decided to end his life. Hope just was not strong enough a force to convince him not to jump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point the light from above (though he originally thought of the direction of the light as below, the feeling of slowing had convinced him that this was now above him) had grown to a point where the walls of the hole were lit sufficiently for Frank to understand his surroundings slightly better. He could suddenly discern walls on all sides, and the hole was revealed to be a very perfect cylinder through which he was plummeting upwards through space. The diameter of the hole was surprisingly small, maybe about 20 feet, and Frank felt the impossibility of his situation stronger than ever. How had he not impacted the walls at some point during his fall? Was it this narrow the entire way down and up? Or did he somehow thread this needle by angling himself unconsciously toward the light? Any minor shift in his body he noticed himself drift slightly toward one of the sides, and he suddenly became very afraid. He held as still as he could and tried his best to stay centered while approaching what seemed like the end of his journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now the light above him was quite large, but not perfectly cylindrical as he had previously thought. No, there was a small indentation in the circle of light, which was now blinding him with its intensity. Suddenly he perceived why: Rushing past him, again appearing at some point without him noticing, was a ladder on the side of the hole, rushing past him so fast it looked like a solid plank of steel. But the light was quite bright in the hole now, and he was instantly convinced that it was a ladder, built by some unknown party to assist travelers through this nightmarish journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank had never experienced a pivotal moment in his life before now. There were many defining moments of his existence, from experiences at school, to graduation and entering the workforce, to his marriage and later divorce, to his decision to jump into the hole through which he was now falling. But all of these events in his life had been part of the churn of existence, and usually resolved themselves over the course of days, weeks or months. He had never in his life had to make a truly split second decision, aside from maybe a few moments while driving on the highway that someone had pulled dangerously in front of him, but those were largely resolved by pure animal instinct and reflexes. Never had he been confronted with a challenge like grasping the ladder, and he experienced full minutes of frozen panic at the thought of what he was going to have to do. Luckily the slowing of his body took much longer than he expected, and he had about a full half an hour to come to terms with this and mentally prepare himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he started to slow down to reasonable speeds, he could all of a sudden discern the individual rungs of the ladder, which had previously looked like a steel blur. The rungs of the ladder rushing by made an optical illusion similar to the effect of staring at car wheels on the freeway: it looked like the rungs were slowly moving downwards, like an escalator at the mall. Eventually this pattern stopped and the illusion ceased, and it became clear that the time was now or never. Frank, now very able to control his ascent after quite a bit of practice, slightly reoriented himself and moved to within three feet of the ladder, still rushing by at speeds that would certainly break his arms or worse if he tried to grasp them. He took a deep breath and concentrated as hard as he could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Frank hit the apex of his ascent, his stomach gave out again. There was a feeling of total weightlessness that washed over his entire body. He could not tell if time had slowed, but it sure felt like it had. He was so caught up in this feeling that he almost forgot to grab the ladder, but at possibly the last moment, after falling about a foot back down into the blackness, his arms shot out and grabbed a rung of the ladder and held on for dear life. His body, still three or so feet away from the ladder, wrenched forward and painfully smacked into the lower rungs. The wind was knocked out of Frank and he almost let go, but he managed to regain his composure and held on tight. He was safe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But his feeling of relief turned again to terror as he tilted his head up to see the distance he had to climb. His fall had not taken him all the way up, instead the entrance (exit?) to the hole was still quite far above him. He estimated maybe a thousand feet between him and whatever the other side may be. Frank was still experiencing hunger and thirst, but at least he had gotten plenty of sleep on his journey, so the fear of needing to attempt a base camp on the side of the hole seemed to be unjustified. He made sure he had a decent footing and began the long ascent upwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank had never climbed a ladder that was not attached to a bunk bed before, and found it much harder to do than it looked. He had not seriously exercised his upper body in many years and thus had to rely on his legs as the primary source of locomotion. Climbing the ladder this far was not unlike climbing the stairwell of a skyscraper, and after a hundred or so rungs he felt fully exhausted and unable to continue. This felt very ironic to Frank; he had made it this far and finally had been given an opportunity to do something besides wait for fate to decide his future, and had utterly failed this arduous test. He was nearly ready to let go and begin another trip through the abyss, but there was certainly no ladder on the other side of the hole and he knew he would be resigned to a fate of starvation in total blackness. This did not appeal to Frank, so his force of will began to push his legs ever upward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few hours of agony, Frank sprawled out over the top of the hole. Panting heavily, he thought that this was perhaps the most important moment of his life. He had made it! Where he had made it to, he had no idea. His eyes were still adjusting to the daylight, as he had spent what felt like several days in total blackness, so he could not see any of his surroundings. He could not hear much either, other than some wind rushing past his ears. He felt grass underneath him, grass that was damp and uncomfortable but real and tangible and therefore better than anything back down in the hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank’s eyes slowly adjusted to his surroundings. He could now hear birds chirping and waves crashing on a shore, and looking out for the first time with clear eyes he could see a dense tropical forest. Frank saw now that he was on a small island, one with maybe a few thousand feet of space in all directions before ending abruptly in ocean currents. It was a paradise, one Frank may have enjoyed more if he weren’t so hungry and thirsty. He began to wander the small island, peering through the dense grove for sustenance or civilization, but found neither. After about an hour he headed for the shore and sat down on the beach. He took off his shoes and socks and felt the sand between his toes. He was not sure what was to come. He was already forgetting his life before this, images of the other side were slipping away. This island was not home to him, not yet, but it was where he was at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Frank had a lot of time to think while he was falling. How long he wasn’t exactly sure, but it had certainly been a few hours since his jump. He was now in pitch black darkness, the pinhole of light that had marked the opening of the hole he had jumped into had been swallowed up by the darkness about an hour into his journey. Though there was still air to breathe and to resist his fall, the whistling of the air caused by his body plummeting was so monotone that his brain had essentially shut it off in his head completely. So he was in total sensory deprivation and thus had a lot of time to think.</summary></entry></feed>
