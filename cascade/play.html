      <h1>Case 1: Blood on the Snow</h1>

      <h2>Started June 26, 2016 at 4:20PM</h2>

      <p>You're spending your winter vacation in a cottage in Seanberry in Yorkshire. You're about to start your evening bridge game, when there is a sudden knock at the door. It's the local chief constable. He thought it best to let you know in person: A bloody murder took place in the early evening! "Doubtless," as until now, the body of the victim has not been found.</p>

      <p>The chief constable has had a <b>sketch made of the footprints found at the crime scene</b> (which should be brought to you at any moment so that you can examine it).</p>

      <p>In the meantime, you're trying to remember if you happened to have observed any unique shoes or <b>footprints of people</b> exhibiting suspicious behavior...</p>

      <p>Your colleagues are investigating the issue and will contact you shortly. Answer the questions to solve the case when you think you're ready. But be careful! Wrong answers will potentially get an innocent person locked up.</p>

      <p>Making things worse for your team, since the budget cuts kicked in for our department, we are not allowed to make phone calls anymore. In fact, between the whole team, we are limited to 10 text messages to solve this whole case.</p>

      <p>To make things fair, we'll go in order. Your colleague will relay information to you before you are authorized to send a text. Your target will not have the previous agent's information, so you should include  <b>everything</b> you know about the case so far. As soon as we can, someone else will text you again with a summary of the whole case, condensed into 160 characters.</p>

      <h2>Will you be able to solve the mystery of Seanberry's bodiless crime? Fill in the answers as soon as you are confident! You'll get to see how everyone answered when everyone has submitted or the case expires.</h2>

     <p>You get one point per question answered correctly, for a total of 3 possible. But remember: you're not out here for glory, you're here to catch a criminal. The only score that matters on the leaderboard is your teams' score, which is all the players' scores added together. Giving your teammates bad information won't help anyone, so do your best.</p>
