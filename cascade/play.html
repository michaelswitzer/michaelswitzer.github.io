      <h2>The Story So Far</h2>

      <p>You're spending your winter vacation in a cottage in Seanberry in Yorkshire. You're about to start your evening bridge game, when there is a sudden knock at the door. It's the local chief constable. He thought it best to let you know in person: A bloody murder took place in the early evening! "Doubtless," as until now, the body of the victim has not been found.</p>

      <p>The chief constable has had a <b>sketch made of the footprints found at the crime scene</b> (which should be brought to you at any moment so that you can examine it).</p>

      <p>In the meantime, you're trying to remember if you happened to have observed any unique shoes or <b>footprints of people</b> exhibiting suspicious behavior...</p>

      <h2>What You Have Learned</h2>

      I was intrigued by the man named <b>Troy</b>. His <b>footprints</b> in the snow looked like they were a kind of boot. The only noticeable tread pattern showed three thick vertical bars near the soles of his shoes.

      <h3>Will you be able to solve the mystery of Seanberry's bodiless crime? </h3>
      <h3>This investigation has been closed! It's time to submit the evidence. Answer these three questions to close this case!</h3>

     <p>You get one point per question answered correctly, for a total of 3 possible. But remember: you're not out here for glory, you're here to catch a criminal. The only score that matters on the leaderboard is your teams' score, which is all the players' scores added together. Giving your teammates bad information won't help anyone, so do your best.</p>
