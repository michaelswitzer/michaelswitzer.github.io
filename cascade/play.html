      <h2>The Story So Far</h2>

      <p>You're spending your winter vacation in a cottage in Seanberry in Yorkshire. You're about to start your evening bridge game, when there is a sudden knock at the door. It's the local chief constable. He thought it best to let you know in person: A bloody murder took place in the early evening! "Doubtless," as until now, the body of the victim has not been found.</p>

      <p>The chief constable has had a <b>sketch made of the footprints found at the crime scene</b> (which should be brought to you at any moment so that you can examine it).</p>

      <p>In the meantime, you're trying to remember if you happened to have observed any unique shoes or <b>footprints of people</b> exhibiting suspicious behavior...</p>

      <h2>The Rules</h2>

      <p>Your colleagues are investigating the case and will contact you shortly. After 24 hours, the case is closed and you will be asked to answer the case. But be careful! Wrong answers will potentially get an innocent person locked up.</p>

      <p>Making things worse for your team, since the budget cuts kicked in for our department, we are not allowed to make phone calls anymore. In fact, between the whole team, we are limited to 10 text messages to solve this whole case.</p>

      <p>To make things fair, we'll go in order. Your colleague will relay information to you before you are authorized to send a text. Your target will not have the previous agent's information, so you should include  <b>everything</b> you know about the case so far. As soon as we can, someone else will text you again with a summary of the whole case, condensed into 160 characters.</p>

      <h3>Will you be able to solve the mystery of Seanberry's bodiless crime? </h3>
      <h3>This investigation has been closed! It's time to submit the evidence. Answer these three questions to close this case!</h3>

     <p>You get one point per question answered correctly, for a total of 3 possible. But remember: you're not out here for glory, you're here to catch a criminal. The only score that matters on the leaderboard is your teams' score, which is all the players' scores added together. Giving your teammates bad information won't help anyone, so do your best.</p>
