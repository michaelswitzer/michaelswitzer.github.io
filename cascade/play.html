      <h2>The Story So Far</h2>

      <p>You're spending your winter vacation in a cottage in Seanberry in Yorkshire. You're about to start your evening bridge game, when there is a sudden knock at the door. It's the local chief constable. He thought it best to let you know in person: A bloody murder took place in the early evening! "Doubtless," as until now, the body of the victim has not been found.</p>

      <p>The chief constable has had a <b>sketch made of the footprints found at the crime scene</b> (which should be brought to you at any moment so that you can examine it).</p>

      <p>In the meantime, you're trying to remember if you happened to have observed any unique shoes or <b>footprints of people</b> exhibiting suspicious behavior...</p>

      <h2>What You Have Learned</h2>

      I was intrigued by the man named <b>Troy</b>. His <b>footprints</b> in the snow looked like they were a kind of boot. The only noticeable tread pattern showed three thick vertical bars near the soles of his shoes.

      <h2>The Rules</h2>

      <p>You aren't investigating this case alone. Here is your team:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>MS</li>
        <li>DT</li>
        <li>TS</li>
        <li>SK</li>
      </ol>

      <p>As a top secret investigation can often be conducted far behind enemy lines, communication will be extremely limited. We can sneak 10 messages through at most. You and the team have to solve this one as best you can.</p>

      <p>You were texted when the game started. To send a message to another player, reply to the message you were sent and prefix your message with your destination player's codename:</p>

      <p>"MS Hello how are you doing? Nice day today huh?"</p>

      <p>As you play more and approach the top of the leaderboards, the number of messages your teams will collectively receive becomes less and less. In this way Cascade's difficulty level is self adjusting.</p>

      <p>You can quit at any time by replying "quit" to our messages. The game will be forfeited and you will not receive messages. Quitting a game will also turn off auto enroll, so make sure you turn it back on if you want to continue playing Cascade regularly.</p>

      <p>When all the texts are used up, the case is closed and 3 questions are revealed. Answer those questions correctly in the next 24 hours and your team gains a point. You will be evaluated at the end of the game based on your teams' score.</p>

      <p><b>This is very important: Messages are only up to 160 characters, or one text message. That's all you get. Do not send more than 160 characters or it will not reach its destination.</b></p> 

      <h3>Will you be able to solve the mystery of Seanberry's bodiless crime? </h3>
      <h3>This investigation has been closed! It's time to submit the evidence. Answer these three questions to close this case!</h3>

     <p>You get one point per question answered correctly, for a total of 3 possible. But remember: you're not out here for glory, you're here to catch a criminal. The only score that matters on the leaderboard is your teams' score, which is all the players' scores added together. Giving your teammates bad information won't help anyone, so do your best.</p>
