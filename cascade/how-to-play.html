      <h1>How to play Cascade</h1>

      <h2>The Rules</h2>

      <p>When you join a game of Cascade, you will be sent a short summary of the case you must solve. In here the backstory, the mystery and the initial evidence is established. The rest of your team also received this summary. You and your randomly assigned team have 24 hours to solve the case.</p>

      <p>Then, you will be sent a MMS with secret information necessary to solve the case with. You and only you saw this message, so you need to summarize it for your team. You will need your own information as well as all your teams' as well to solve the case properly.</p>

      <p>You will reply to the MMS with a 160-character-or-less summary of the secret information you were given. This is how you convey information to your team.</p>

      <p>Once everyone submits their summary or the game expires (24 hours), your reply is sent to the rest of your team, and you receive all the messages your teammates wrote. Now that you have all the information, it is time to solve the case!</p>

      <p>You will be asked a number of questions in succession. Answering the questions will require information from your entire team, so we hope they summarized their findings well!</p>

      <p>When you answer a question, capitalization and punctuation don't matter. Actually, to be honest with you, neither does word order. So if the question asks you to list several things the order you list them shouldn't matter. Usually though, a question will only require a 1 or 2 word answer.</p>

      <p>The final score you get for the case is equal to <b>all investigators on your teams' score added together.</b> That means your position on the leaderboard is dependent on how well you work with your team, not just your own score, so do your best to be a team player! Cascade is as much about interpreting information from other players as it is sharing it just as effectively.</p>

      <h1>That's not the only way to play though...</h1>

      <p>Cascade is meant to be a collaborative game. Players are encouraged to submit additional content to Cascade as well as play it. Contributing to Cascade is another way to have fun playing, and you can earn points to play for free when people work through your cases! If you are interested in submitting a case to the Cascade Archives, you should head on over to the <a href=./submit.html>Submit a Case</a> page.</p>
