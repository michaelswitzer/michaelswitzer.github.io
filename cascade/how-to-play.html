      <h1>How to play Cascade</h1>

      <h2>The Rules</h2>

      <p>As a top secret investigation can often be conducted far behind enemy lines, communication will be extremely limited. We can sneak 10 messages through at most. You and the team have to solve this one as best you can.</p>

      <p>You were texted when the game started. To send a message to another player, reply to the message you were sent and prefix your message with your destination player's codename:</p>

      <p>"MS Hello how are you doing? Nice day today huh?"</p>

      <p>As you play more and approach the top of the leaderboards, the number of messages your teams will collectively receive becomes less and less. In this way Cascade's difficulty level is self adjusting.</p>

      <p>You can quit at any time by replying "quit" to our messages. The game will be forfeited and you will not receive messages. Quitting a game will also turn off auto enroll, so make sure you turn it back on if you want to continue playing Cascade regularly.</p>

      <p>When all the texts are used up, the case is closed and 3 questions are revealed. Answer those questions correctly in the next 24 hours and your team gains a point. You will be evaluated at the end of the game based on your teams' score.</p>

      <p><b>This is very important: Messages are only up to 160 characters, or one text message. That's all you get. Do not send more than 160 characters or it will not reach its destination.</b></p> 

      <h2>Getting started</h2>
      <p>Once you've added a phone number to your account, you will be automatically enrolled in a case within 24 hours (if you're not ready to play yet, disable Auto Enroll on the <a href=./settings.html>Settings</a> page). You will receive a text message letting you know that the case has begun. Cases are limited to 48 hours long, but often finish long before.</p>
      <p>Browse to the <a href=./play.html>Solve a Case</a> page. You and the rest of the investigators can read the introduction to the case.</p>
      <p>You can also see the results of your own investigation into the case. The other investigators cannot see this information, so you will need to do your best to communicate it to them. They also have important information that you will need to solve the case.</p>
      <p>Communication with other investigators will be extremely limited. At some points during the case, you will be given an opportunity to send a single 160 character SMS to a fellow investigator. Use this opportunity to share <b>all</b> the information you have about the case with them.</p>
      <p>You might receive much more information through your investigation that will not fit into a single text message. You will often have to shorten phrases or omit some information, so try to figure out what's important and what isn't before you send anything to your teammates.</p>
      <p>You will also periodically recieve information from your fellow investigators. They too have received more information than they could send, so try and figure out exactly what they were trying to tell you. Understanding information received from your fellow investigators will be essential to solve the case.</p>
      <p>Information you receive from your fellow investigators also needs to be passed on in addition to your own information. The recipient of your message will not have heard from everyone, so you will need to synthesize all the information you've received so far and fit it into a single text message as best you can.</p>
      <p>Once all the communications have been sent between investigators (or when 24 hours have passed), the investigation is closed and communication is no longer allowed between investigators. Browse to the <a href=./play.html>Solve a Case</a> page and you will see 3 questions to answer. Answering a question correctly gives your team 1 point.</p>
      <p>The final score for the case is equal to each investigators' individual score added together. Your position on the leaderboard is dependent on how well you work with your team, not just your own score, so do your best to be a team player!</p>
      <h1>That's not the only way to play though...</h1>
      <p>Cascade is meant to be a collaborative game. Players are encouraged to submit additional content to Cascade as well as play it.
