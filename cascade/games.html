      <h1>Case 1: Blood on the Snow</h1>

      <h3>Started June 26, 2016 at 4:20PM</h3>

      <p>You're spending your winter vacation in a cottage in Seanberry in Yorkshire. You're about to start your evening bridge game, when there is a sudden knock at the door. It's the local chief constable. He thought it best to let you know in person: A bloody murder took place in the early evening! "Doubtless," as until now, the body of the victim has not been found.</p>

      <p>The chief constable has had a <b>sketch made of the footprints found at the crime scene</b> (which should be brought to you at any moment so that you can examine it).</p>

      <p>In the meantime, you're trying to remember if you happened to have observed any unique shoes or <b>footprints of people</b> exhibiting suspicious behavior...</p>

      <p>Will you be able to solve the mystery of Seanberry's bodiless crime? Your colleagues are investigating the issue and will contact you shortly. Answer the questions to solve the case when you think you're ready. But be careful! Wrong answers will potentially get an innocent person locked up.</p>

      <p>Blast! We only brought one piece of paper between all of us. The snow is melting fast and there's no chance to get some more. We need to keep all the notes we take for the investigation on this sheet, so keep it brief will 'ya?</p>

      <p>Solving the crime faster will result in more points. Compete with friends on the leaderboard!</p>
