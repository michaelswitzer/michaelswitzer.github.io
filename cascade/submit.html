        <h1>Submit a case to the Cascade Archives</h1>
        <p>Submit your Case to the Cascade Archives and other players can sign up to play it! Each time your case is completed by other players, you receieve 1/2 of the points the players spent added directly to your balance. That means you can play Cascade for free by contributing quality content to it!</p> 
        <p>Here are the rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You need to play 5 cases before you submit a case.</li>
            <li>Make sure you need information from each investigator to solve the case. Do not make any participants' role meaningless. </li>
            <li>No profanity, racism or intolerance.</li>
            <li>No extreme violence. It can be a murder case, but don't go into the details!</li>
            <li>No politics unless it's over 200 years old.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cases will be reviewed for approved content before they become available.</p>
