## Who are you?
My name is Mike and I am a software product manager based in the Seattle area.

## Can I use your content?
Unless specifically specified, I own all of the content on this site; it is copyright Michael Switzer. You do not need to ask me before linking to this site, but please do not leech my images or copy my work anywhere else. If you have any specific inquiries about this, feel free to reach out through the contact links below.

## How did you make this site?
I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to generate static pages, which I host for free on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). I happen to like the default theme for Jekyll, [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), so I use a lightly adapted version for this site. The source code is freely available at my [github](https://github.com/michaelswitzer/michaelswitzer.github.io).
