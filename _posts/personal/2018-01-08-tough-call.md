Drifting down the Hill on the way to Belltown, dogs occupying all fields of view, a man lost his way and found himself in the back section of Whole Foods comparing two brands of local raw honey.

His mind’s eye shifted to the blurred modern-gothic castle in which he resided. Focusing on a specific shelf in the pantry, he tried with every ounce of strength to recall which brand his wife had bought last, to no avail. “Come to think of it,” he said aloud accidentally, he also could not remember if he had been satisfied with the experience that the brand had provided.

Finally his eyes lit up.

“Six dollars is too much, four dollars is far more appropriate”, he beamed, and success tasted sweet on the rest of his walk.
