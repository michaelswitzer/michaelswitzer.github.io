## "Not fair! You Just Got Lucky"

This is the first post in a series about randomness in games. Randomness is a core element of many games, and a peripheral element of many more. As a game designer, it is important to examine the role of randomness in a game and how it can enhance or detract from the players' experience. In this series, we will examine how randomness can be classified into different categories of game feature, and how these classifications affect gameplay in a general sense. Though I believe the classifications I outline here are observable on an objective basis, this is fundamentally an opinionated post so take what is said here with a grain of salt.

## Gambling away your agency

Let's start with a very simple game, with a strong component of randomness: The slot machine.

Slots have essentially zero player agency: the player wagers some of their resources, and the machine tells them whether they have won or lost. Slots are wildly popular; up to [70% of income generated by casinos comes from players sitting and spinning](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/12/sit-and-spin/304392/). 

Despite delegating exactly zero choices to the player, slots remain popular. Why is that? The important takeaway is that zero player agency does not indicate there is only one outcome for the player. Even though the player has no control over the situation, there is still a wide range of possibilities for success or failure. If the slot machine did not produce a range of outcomes, if it simply ate the player's money with no chance for winnings, nobody would play it. The fun, then, is derived from randomness as a _suspense engine_. I use the term "suspense engine" to refer to any randomness applied to a game that assists in determining outcomes.

Suspense engines drive essentially all casino games. No matter the preferred game for a gambler, the strategy remains the same: input some money and the house tells you whether you won or not. Whether the game is blackjack, roulette, craps, or anything else, the player is expected to leave their success or failure completely up to the suspense engine.

Though they aren't my personal preference, I cannot make the claim that casino games are not engaging and interesting to many people. The term "gambing addiction" would not exist if casino games did not compel certain people to play them. But I will say with some degree of confidence that _games that are reliant on suspense engines to drive the action are not compelling in of themselves_. Slot machines have flashing lights and exciting sounds, as well as the possibility of winning real money, which captivates players and keeps them interested. Taking the stakes away equates to taking the fun away.

## Mechanics + Theme = Fun

In game design we refer to the peripheral elements of the presentation of the game generally as its _theme_. A game like Chess is not a strongly thematic game, while almost all casino games (dripping with flashy distractions and holding real, material stakes) are highly thematic.

Here is another slot machine with a theme:

![Candyland Board Game (fair use)]({{site.url}}/assets/posts/randomness/Classic_Candy_Land_by_Winning_Moves.jpg)

The outcome of a game of Candyland is determined before play begins. Once the deck of movement cards is shuffled, the players are reliant on the suspense engine and the theme to enjoy the game. Candyland is very suitable for young children who are not ready for higher levels of complexity, but for most adults the game gets boring rather quickly.

I am not picking on a children's toy or saying it should try to do anything more than it does. The game is, in fact, commercially successful because of its simplicity and accessibility as a result of removing determinism from the player. In leaning heavily on the suspense engine, though, the game becomes more reliant on its thematic elements to provide an interesting experience for the player.

The converse of this is that games with very weak suspense engines are less reliant on their theme. Take Chess for example. Chess lacks a cohesive theme or material incentive to play, yet has a huge amount of player determinism. The only random element it contains is the initial turn order. The game has a very high skill ceiling, enabling players to enjoy Chess for years or more. Due to the agency offered to the players, Chess enjoys significant success dating back hundreds of years.

## A Balancing Act

So if we accept that player determinism _or_ attractive theme is necessary, then we have a model for creating successful games. So theme and determinism drive game quality:

Suspense engines decrease player determinism, which reduces game quality:

But on the flip side, decreased player determinism signals reduced complexity and increased accessibility, meaning the game can appeal to a wider audience.

Successful games require enough quality to be compelling and enough accessibility to find an audience. Following our model, if a game is going to compromise its quality by removing determinism, a designer has to provide a strong theme for the player to connect with. For a child, this might be a cutesy fantasy world. For an adult, it may mean flashing lights and real stakes. In both cases, the game's chance of success goes up dramatically.

## Thank you

This concludes part 1 of a multi part series on randomness in games. Randomness is not strictly applied in games in the form of suspense engines, and it is possible to introduce randomness to a game in ways that do not reduce player agency. Instead, randomness may be used to provide an organically unique experience for the player with each playthrough, or even to enrich the thematic nature of the game. We will explore the latter in the form of _story engines_, in part 2 of this series. Thanks for reading!
